Please do not ignore this message. By the end of January 2023, this computer will be removed from the Information Services support structure and lead to certain features being removed from the device, along with any UoE registered wired network connection. We can only recommend that you replace this computer with a macOS device with more up to date hardware, so that you can receive full support from Information Services.

This message will appear once per day until the device is removed from the UoE support structure.

For any questions, or if you wish to remove the device from support before end of January 2023, please contact IS Helpline - IS.Helpline@ed.ac.uk
