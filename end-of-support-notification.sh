    -description "The University of Edinburghâ€™s Sustainable IT programme has implemented a replacement cycle policy for macOS managed computers, where desktops older than 7 years and laptops older than 6 years will need to be replaced.

It has been brought to our attention that this device is now past its replacement cycle policy:

$MODEL

Please do not ignore this message. By the end of January 2023, this computer will be removed from the Information Services support structure and lead to certain features being removed from the device, along with any UoE registered wired network connection. We can only recommend that you replace this computer with a macOS device with more up to date hardware, so that you can receive full support from Information Services.
